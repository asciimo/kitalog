**Kitalog** is a LAN-based web application that makes it effortless to share files, images, links, and plain text messages with anyone on the same local network regardless of their OS. It’s like iMessage meets AirDrop — all in your browser, with no installs[^1], logins, or cloud dependency.

## 🐾 Why “Kitalog”?

It’s a friendly mashup of “catalog” and “kitten,” because why not? This app is meant to feel warm, low-friction, and useful — a digital drop zone for home, work, or anything in between.
